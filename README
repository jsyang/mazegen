Mazegen - 2013 End of Year Edition!

jsyang.ca@gmail.com

Wrote this for a special new years message! Basically it's a souped
up version of the maze generator originally in this repo. Those files
have now been moved into the `old/` directory.

Run any local server on this repo and you'll see things happen.
Enjoy!
