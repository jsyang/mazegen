"Mazegen" - jsyang.ca@gmail.com

Maze generator toy that draws mazes with tables and CSS-borders instead of
canvas: runs in IE and also quite well on the Kindle experimental browser.

Uses the basic recursive backtracker algorithm to carve a maze out of 
untouched cells in the grid. Also implemented in mazegen.html is a basic
editor to create a logo array: mark cells as visited before the maze carving
begins- the logo will remain unmolested as the carving proceeds.
